# Project Overview
In this project, I chose a very popular example of classification. It is either 0 or 1. It either happened or it didn't happen. For example, cancer is positive or not, the production part is working or not working, tomorrow it will rain or not, etc.

I worked with the project in Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. I  focused on predicting the survival data for passengers. I followed a process of problem definition, gathering data, preparing data, explanatory data analysis, coming up with a data model, validating the model, and optimizing the model further.

Let's take a look at the steps:

<a id="ch2"></a>
# Data Science Steps
1. **Problem Definition:** What factors determined whether someone survived a disaster? Using passenger data, we were able to identify certain groups of people who were more likely to survive.
2. **Data Gathering:** Kaggle provided the input data on their website.
3. **Data Preparation:** I prepared the data by analyzing data points that were missing or outliers.
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** If you input garbage data into a system, you'll get garbage output. Therefore, it is important to use descriptive and graphical statistics to look for patterns, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In this step, I analyzed the data to make sure it was understandable.
5. **Data Modeling:** It is important to know when to select a model. If we choose the wrong model for a particular use case, all other steps become pointless. 
6. **Validate Model:** After training the model, I checked its performance and looked for any issues with overfitting or underfitting.
7. **Optimize Model:** Using techniques like hyperparameter optimization, I worked on making the model better.

# Step 1: Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to predict the survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic.

**Project Summary from Kaggle:**
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most famous maritime disasters in history. On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. This was considered to be an unsinkable ship, but nonetheless it went down due to the accident. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship, resulting in the death of 1502 people out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Some groups of people seemed to be more likely to survive than others, although luck was involved. In this challenge, they want us to create a predictive model that can identify who is more likely to survive based on data about passengers (name, age, gender, social class, etc).

# Step 2: Data Gathering

The dataset can be found on Kaggle's main page for this project: [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

<a id="ch5"></a>
# Step 3: Data Preperation
The data was pre-processed by Kaggle, so I only focused on cleaning it up further.

**This is the input data from Kaggle :**  ['gender_submission.csv', 'test.csv', 'train.csv']

## 3.2 Pre-view of the Data
The *Survived* variable is the outcome or dependent variable. The datatype is 1 if the person survived and 0 if they did not survive. The rest of the variables are independent variables. Most variable names are self explanatory but a couple may be worth mentioning. The *SibSp* represents the number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic and *Parch* represents the number of parents / children aboard the Titanic.

## 3.3 Data Pre-processing: 
I cleaned the data by identifying and removing abnormal values and outliers, filled in missing data where appropriate, worked on improving the features, and performed data conversion. I used Label encoder to convert objects to categories. 

Divided the data into 75/25 format. 75 is training and 25 is test.

# Step 4: Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)

After cleaning and organizing the data, it is important to explore it in order to find any insights. I used EDA to visualize the data I am working with, in order to better understand its properties and statistics. 

![Titanic_Project_28_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic3.jpg)

Looking at individual features by survival:

![Titanic_Project_29_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic4.jpg)

I then compared class and a 2nd feature:

![Titanic_Project_30_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic5.jpg)

Followed by comparing sex and a 2nd feature:

![Titanic_Project_31_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic6.jpg)

Family size and sex vs survival and class and sex vs survival:

![Titanic_Project_32_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic7.jpg)

Embark data visualization with class and sex vs survival:

![Titanic_Project_33_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic8.jpg)

Distributions of age of passengers who survived or did not survive:

![Titanic_Project_34_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic9.jpg)

Histogram comparison of sex, class, and age by survival:

![Titanic_Project_35_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic10.jpg)

# Step 5: Data Modelling

I will use a supervised learning classification algorithm for predicting the binary ourcome (survived or not). Here are some resources I found helpful: 

**Some Machine Learning Classification Algorithms:**
* [Ensemble Methods](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.ensemble)
* [Generalized Linear Models (GLM)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.linear_model)
* [Naive Bayes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.naive_bayes)
* [Nearest Neighbors](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neighbors)
* [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.svm)
* [Decision Trees](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree)
* [Discriminant Analysis](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.discriminant_analysis)


### Which Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) to choose ?
Deciding on which model to use is never a straight answer. In practice, best approach is to work on different algorithms and then compare their performace. Below I summarized the models I worked with, and their performances:

![compare_mla.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic13.jpg)

Then let's see the barplot showing the accuracy score:

## 5.1 Evaluate Model Performance
After some data pre-processing, analysis, and machine learning algorithms (MLA), I was able to predict passenger survival with ~82% accuracy. Can I do better?


### Somethings to consider: ###
I improved the data by using the learnings from EDA. This is the result of the Decision Tree model after data improvements:


![handmade_model_score.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic15.jpg)

The confusion matrix without normalization:

![Titanic_Project_44_1.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic16.jpg)

Confusion matrix with normalization:

![Titanic_Project_44_2.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic17.jpg)

# 5.11 Model Performance with Cross-Validation (CV) 
In this section, I worked on cross validation (CV). I leveraged the [sklearn cross_validate function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#multimetric-cross-validation). Some advantages of sklearn cross_validate function are:

- It allows specifying multiple metrics for evaluation.
- It returns a dict containing fit-times, score-times in addition to the test score.

 By using CV I was also automatically able to split and score the model multiple times, to get an idea of how well it will perform on unseen data.

<a id="ch10"></a>
# 5.12 Tune Model with Hyper-Parameters
I worked on hyper-parameter optimization to see how various hyper-parameter settings will change the model accuracy. 

Decision trees are simple to understand usually. They can also be visualized. Data prep is quite easy compared to other methods. They can handle both numeric and categorical data. We can validate a model using tests.

However, decision trees do not generalize data well, they do have a tendency to memorize (overfitting). Pruning can be used to overcome this issue. Small variations may impact the decision trees hugely. They can be biased if some classes dominate.


DT before any optimization:

<a id="ch11"></a>
## 5.13 Tune Model with Feature Selection
Recursive feature elimination (RFE) with cross validation (CV) is used for feature selection:

![feature_elimination.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic19.jpg)

<a id="ch12"></a>
# Step 6: Correlation of Models

Comparison of algorithm predictions with each other, where 1 = similar and 0 = not similar in a heatmap:

![Titanic_Project_54_0.jpg](/images/titanic/titanic20.jpg)

I have been working on using multiple models instead of choosing one. This gave me a chance to create a supermodel. Removed models that correlates exactly with another model (1).

I worked on voting rules that used hard or majority votes, as well as those that used weighted probabilities. I tuned each estimator before creating a supermodel.

<a id="ch13"></a>
# Conclusion

The model achieved an accuracy of about 78% when predicting the outcomes of unseen data. This was achieved with a simple decision tree. Which decision tree algorithm is best for my data: simple vs an improved model? The simple decision tree algorithm had a better default submission score, and with tuning, I was still able to achieve the same best accuracy score as the one I achieved using a simple decision tree model. The cross-validation accuracy score was much higher than the submission accuracy score.

Next steps will involve further preprocessing and feature engineering to improve the CV score and Kaggle score as well as the overall accuracy.
